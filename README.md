- I am @lm3m or Lukas or Luke
- This is the code I write when I am left to my own devices. Mostly C++, but I try to be pragmatic and use the right tool for the problem at hand.
- I am currently playing with modern C++, microcontrollers, Eurorack, MIDI, reviving a strange audio visualizer, and other shiny things that catch my eye.
- How to reach me: `@lm3m@mas.to` on mastadon or `lm3m.bsky.com` on bluesky or `lm3m at msn.com` https://linktr.ee/lm3m
